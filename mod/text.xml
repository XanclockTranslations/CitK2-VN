        <part0>Crisis in the Kremlin: Cold War – a real-time political strategy game. In the game, you will take on the role of the head of state and save {2} from collapse. To achieve this, various tools for managing the country are at your disposal — conducting foreign and domestic policy, controlling the economy and budget, and interacting with ministers and other politicians.</part0>
        <part1>The user interface of all sections consists of several parts. At the top of the screen, you will find the main foreign and domestic political indicators of the country, warnings, and the game time control panel. In the bottom right corner are buttons for navigating to other sections.</part1>
        <part2>The current game date is displayed at the top of the screen. Game time is activated with the buttons {2} {3} {4}, which control its speed. You can change the game time speed using the keys “1”, “2”, “3”. The {5} button pauses the game time. You can also pause time by pressing the “SPACE” key.</part2>
        <part3>Activate the game time by pressing {2} {3} or {4}.</part3>
        <part4>An event has appeared. When an event occurs, game time automatically pauses. You can open the event only when the government is fully staffed. {0}Click the event icon or press "E" to open it.</part4>
        <part5>The event window has opened. There are three types of events in the game. {0}1. Newspaper event – where there are no response options. {0}2. Standard event – with multiple response options. {0}3. Dialogue event – where one of the politicians addresses you with response options.</part5>
        <part6>This event is a newspaper event. There are no response options, but it can affect game parameters. You can scroll through the event text using the scroll bar or the mouse wheel. {0}After reading, press the "Next" button.</part6>
        <part7>Activate the game time by pressing {2} {3} or {4}, and open the next event.</part7>
        <part8var0>This event is a regular one. It can have from one to several response options. Dialog events are arranged similarly.</part8var0>
        <part8var1>This event is a dialogue one. It can have from one to several response options. Regular events are arranged similarly.</part8var1>
        <part9>Some response options may have conditions that make them available.{0}{2} – means the conditions are met.{0}{3} – means the conditions are not met.{0}{4} – means there are no conditions.{0}Conditions can be variable, include multiple points, be mutually exclusive, or complementary.{0}Scroll down to the response options.</part9>
        <part10>Hover over the indicated icon to the left of the response option to view the event conditions.</part10>
        <part11>Hover over the text of the response option to view the result of your selection. Choose any of the response options.</part11>
        <part12>Close the event by pressing "Next".</part12>

        <part13>Let's move on to other parts of the interface.</part13>
        <part14>In the top left corner, warnings will occasionally appear, informing you of impending crises in various sectors of society, relationships with other countries, or politicians, depending on the situation. Clicking on the warning icon will open the section related to the problematic area.</part14>
        <part15>The main country indicators are located in the top left and right parts of the screen. Most indicators in the game change on the first day of each month.</part15>
        <part16>{2}DEFCON – a scale indicating the readiness level of the U.S. armed forces. It ranges from 5 (normal readiness) to 1 (maximum readiness). If relations with the U.S. fall below 15, the DEFCON level increases by one point. If relations with the U.S. rise above 100, the DEFCON level decreases by one point.</part16>
        <part17>The next three indicators are: {2}Relations with the U.S., {3}Relations with France, {4}Relations with China. These are the main rival countries competing for spheres of diplomatic influence. Deterioration of relations with them can trigger a crisis event.</part17>
        <part18>{2}Military readiness – an indicator of the strength of the country's army. It is involved in wars, events, and other diplomatic actions. If the indicator falls below a certain level, it can trigger a crisis event.</part18>
        <part19>{2}Loyalty of security services – an indicator of the loyalty of the country's security services. It is often used as a condition for certain actions in events, diplomacy, or politics. If the indicator falls below a certain level, it will lead to discontent among the security services and trigger a crisis event.</part19>
        <part20>{2}Political capital – accumulated points of political power. This is the main resource in the game. It is required for conducting internal and foreign policies, making decisions, changing doctrines, appointing ministers, participating in conspiracies, and choosing outcomes in game events.</part20>
        <part21>{2}Total science points – the total number of all types of science points in the game. There are 4 types of science points: {0}{3}Military points{0}{4}Physical points{0}{5}Cybernetic points{0}{6}Civilian points. {0}Contributions to various budget items affect the accumulation of science points. Science points are used to conduct research. You can read more about research in the "Science" section.</part21>
        <part22>{2}Country population – an indicator of the current population of the country. It is summed up by the subjects that are part of the country. If a subject leaves the country, the population will decrease.</part22>
        <part23>{2}Radical opposition strength – an indicator of the influence of the most radical forces and ideas. It affects the destabilization of the country's domestic political situation. Exceeding this indicator beyond a certain level can trigger a crisis event.</part23>
        <part24>{2}Budget balance – the difference between income and expenses. If the budget balance is positive, the amount is added to the {3}Reserve. Otherwise, money is taken from the reserve. If the reserve is depleted, you will need to reduce expenses or take external loans.</part24>
        <part25>{2}Reserve – the accumulated financial reserve. It is used as a condition and expense for most domestic and foreign policy actions. Depleting the reserve below a certain level can trigger a crisis event.</part25>

        <part26>Let's review the main elements of the diplomacy section.</part26>
        <part27>In the upper-right corner, five main diplomatic map modes are presented: {0}{3}Military alliances – a map of all current members of military alliances. {0}{4}Economic blocs – a map of all current members of economic unions. {0}{5}Influence – a map of the influence of major powers. {0}{6}Ideologies – a map of the political systems of countries. {0}{7}Relations with the player – a map of the friendliness of countries towards the player. The warmer the color, the better the relations; the colder the color, the worse the relations. {0}Press {2} to see additional diplomatic map modes.</part27>
        <part28>The scroll bar on the right side of the screen allows you to zoom in or out on the map. This can also be done using the mouse wheel.</part28>
        <part29var0>Let's move on to the countries. Select any of the subjects of the {2} on the map  and click on it with "LMB".</part29var0>
        <part29var1>Let's move on to the countries. Select any country and click on it with "LMB".</part29var1>
        <part30>The country window is divided into two parts: upper and lower.{0}The upper part displays information about the country: name, alliance membership, various indicators. {0}The lower part contains interactions with the country.</part30>
        <part30>The upper part shows information about the country, and the lower part contains buttons for interacting with the country.</part30>
        <part31>To the left of the arrow is the name of the country.{0}The name of the player's country depends on the type of government, decisions made, or doctrines. {0}The names of other countries depend on their type of government.</part31>
        <part32>This panel contains the main information about the foreign policy status of the country: membership in military and economic blocs, presence of a military base, type of dependence on another country, and leadership course of the subject (for the player's country). {0}Hovering over any of the icons will display its current influence. {0}Let's address the two indicated subject icons {2}.</part32>
        <part33>The leadership course of a country demonstrates the subject's policy towards the Center. It can take three forms: {0}{2}Loyal, {0}{3}Moderate, {0}{4}Separatist. {0}The leadership course affects the level of relations with the subject and the direction of diplomacy, expanding or limiting opportunities for interaction with it. {0}The leadership course is influenced by doctrines and the overall situation in the country.</part33>
        <part34>The type of dependence shows the dependent position of a country in relation to a major power. {0}The first three types apply to the player's country subjects: {0}{2}Autonomy, {0}{3}Subject, {0}{4}Equal subject. {0}The type of dependence of subjects changes either when doctrines are changed or when sovereignty is declared. The less autonomy a subject has, the more control and interaction opportunities the player has. However, such restrictions cause dissatisfaction among republican elites.</part34>
        <part35>The following three types refer to independent states:{0}{5}Under occupation{0}{6}Satellite{0}{7}{8}{9}{10}Under the influence of a major power.{0}The less autonomy a country has, the more opportunities for control and interaction with it. However, such restrictions cause dissatisfaction among the national elites.</part35>
        <part36>Government type – the ideological and political system of the country. There are 17 types of government in the game.{0}The player's government type depends on doctrines. You can view the current government system in the "Statistics" section, and its position on the political compass in the "Load/Save" menu.{0}The government type affects the main diplomatic parameters, which will be discussed below.{0}{2}Autonomy and {3}Subject duplicate the country's government type.{0}{4}An equal subject may have a government type independent of the Center.</part36>
        <part37>Ruling party – the current ruling party in the country. The ruling party is the one to which the player belongs.{0}{2}Autonomy duplicates the overall union ruling party.{0}{3}A subject may have separate republican parties that are part of the ruling party.{0}{4}An equal subject may have a ruling party independent of the Center.</part37>
        <part38>Relations – an indicator of the state's favorability towards the player's country.{0}The higher the relations, the more opportunities for interaction with the country. A drop in this indicator for subjects and allied countries can lead to the activation of a crisis event for exiting our sphere of influence.{0}Most third-world countries do not have this indicator.</part38>
        <part39>This position can be occupied by two indicators – the diplomacy vector and the liberalization vector. The diplomacy vector represents the degree of our influence on the country. The higher the vector, the more opportunities for intervention. This is the main indicator for interacting with third-world countries.{0}The liberalization vector indicates public dissatisfaction in allied countries. Too much liberalization can lead to the activation of a crisis event involving civil unrest.</part39>
        <part40>At the bottom of the window, there is a panel for interacting with the country, divided into three sections: "Military", "Economic", and "Diplomatic" actions. Interaction with the country occurs through diplomatic buttons, which can be of two types: one-time and recurring. The first provides a one-time effect, while the second modifies indicators on a recurring basis until the player disables them.</part40>
        <part41>Go to the "Economic" actions section.</part41>
        <part42>Most diplomatic buttons have conditions and effects. It works similarly to events: {0}{2} – means the conditions are met. {0}{3} – means the conditions are not met. {0}Hover over the icon and check the conditions of the "Provide subsidies" button.</part42>
        <part43>Hover over the button and view the effects. Activate the button.</part43>
        <part44>Close the diplomacy window.</part44>
        <part45>The diplomacy section tutorial is complete. In the lower-right corner is the game section panel. You can navigate to any section in any order and read about each of them.</part45>

        <part46>This section presents decisions and modifiers.</part46>
        <part47>Decisions are a set of political actions for implementing domestic and foreign policies, introducing scientific achievements, and carrying out reforms. {0} Decisions are divided into nine categories, eight of which are thematic (Army, Diplomacy, Politics, etc.), and one is a list of already adopted decisions.</part47>
        <part48>Modifiers are various processes, phenomena, decisions, and policies that have a lasting impact on the game's parameters. {0} Modifiers are divided into four categories: Diplomacy, Politics, Economy, and Party.</part48>
        <part49>Go to any of the sections to learn more.</part49>
        <part50>Decisions are divided into two types: One-time and Repeatable. The first can only be adopted once. The second can be used multiple times or modified. {0} Some decisions trigger in-game events. {0} Each decision consists of a description, effects, and conditions. {0} Decisions available for adoption are always at the top of the list.</part50>
        <part51>Hover over the specified button to view the conditions.</part51>
        <part52>View the description and effects using scrolling or the mouse wheel. {0} Go to the modifiers section if you want to learn more about them.</part52>
        <part53>Modifiers are divided into three types: {0} 1. Regular – they only have a recurring influence. {0} 2. Tiered – the impact of the modifiers depends on their level. {0} 3. Tiered with progress – the impact of the modifiers also depends on their level, but the level can increase or decrease based on the progress indicator. {0} Some modifiers have a duration.</part53>
        <part54>Hover over the specified icon to see the recurring influence of the modifier.</part54>
        <part55>Hover over the specified icon. It may display not only the modifier’s influence but also its level and progress (if provided by the modifier). {0} Go to the decisions section if you want to learn more about them.</part55>

        <part56>This section presents statistics for all of the player's country indicators.</part56>
        <part57>Hovering over the country flag shows the current name of the state, its government type, ruling party, and information about the size of the player’s country's alliances.</part57>
        <part58>The statistics can be sorted according to your preference: alphabetically, by increasing or decreasing values.</part58>
        <part59>You can also sort all information into different categories: internal and foreign policy, society, economy, or display all indicators.</part59>
        <part60>Hover over any of the parameters. After the first turn, you will be able to see in a tooltip the monthly influence of modifiers, doctrines, ministers, and other effects on that parameter. {0} Click on any of the parameters.</part60>
        <part61>Here you can see the dynamic change in the selected parameter over a six-month or one-year period.</part61>

        <part62>Economic management is one of the most important parts of the game. This section presents the main spending articles of the country, which are divided into several categories.</part62>
        <part63>You can change the amount of investment using {2} {3} or {4}. {0} When hovering over a budget article, its approximate influence on the country’s indicators is displayed.</part63>
        <part64>Here are the current budget revenues and expenditures. {0} The budget balance is the difference between income and expenses. If the budget balance is positive, the amount is deposited into the Reserve. Otherwise, money is withdrawn from the reserve. If the reserve is depleted, you will need to reduce expenses or take external loans.</part64>
        <part65>Reserve – the accumulated monetary reserve. It is used as a condition and expense for most domestic and foreign policy actions. Depleting the reserve below a certain level may trigger a crisis event.</part65>
        <part66>Export – the share of foreign currency we receive from exports. {0} Under a planned economy, you cannot invest more money in import articles than what you receive from exports.</part66>
        <part67>Accumulated inflation – the process of currency depreciation relative to the monetary base of the starting year. It is a very important indicator in a market economy, with one of the factors to combat it being the refinancing rate. In a planned economy, inflation is unlikely, as only excessive money supply can cause currency depreciation, while smaller-scale situations usually lead to a shortage of goods.</part67>
        <part68>Refinancing rate – the key rate indicator. An important element in controlling inflation in a market economy, which directly or indirectly affects production, business, and opportunities within the country.</part68>
        <part69>Debts to foreign creditors. {0} Our country can take loans from three forces – the USA, France, and the IMF. However, a certain amount of money will be spent on debt repayment each year.</part69>
        <part70>Fixed expenses – monthly mandatory expenses. These consist of debt repayments and interactions with other countries on the diplomatic map.</part70>

        <part71>This is the research section.</part71>
        <part72>All research for the player's country is divided into several categories: space, cybernetics, agro-technologies, military, and nuclear research. Each category contains two branches with different technologies. Some of them can be researched sequentially, while others are mutually exclusive.</part72>
        <part73>Select any of the technologies.</part73>
        <part74>Each technology requires a certain amount of science points. There are 4 types of science points in total: {0}{3} Military points {0}{4} Physical points {0}{5} Cybernetic points {0}{6} Civil points {0} Investments in various budget articles affect the replenishment of science points.</part74>
        <part75>However, it is not enough to research a certain technology. It also needs to be implemented. Most technologies unlock access to decisions.</part75>
        <part76>In addition to the player's country, another superpower, the United States, is also conducting research. Open the specified section with U.S. technologies.</part76>
        <part77>During the Cold War, a technology race for dominance in space, armaments, and computers unfolded. Some U.S. technologies duplicate the player's country’s technologies, so the country that implements them first will gain a significant technological advantage and admiration from the global community. {0} In addition to fundamental technical research, the U.S. also conducts humanitarian research, which can influence the policies of other countries, especially the player's country.</part77>

        <part78>This is the section of the country’s representative body. Depending on the doctrines, it could be the Central Committee of the ruling party or the current parliament of the country.</part78>
        <part79>The game features 8 different factions. Each faction is unique and has its own vision for reforms and state structure. {0} In a multi-party system, each faction transforms into one of two party variations – moderate and radical.</part79>
        <part80>All factions have their open and hidden supporters. Open supporters are those who genuinely sympathize with the faction. Hidden supporters are those who sympathize with a banned faction but are forced to be in another, closest in views from the legal ones. If all factions are allowed, there are no hidden supporters. {0} The size of factions constantly changes due to various factors: ministers, elections, events, and modifiers. {0} Factions, depending on political doctrines, influence the adoption of certain laws, supporting or rejecting them.</part80>
        <part81>You can learn the hidden number of hidden supporters through party or parliamentary investigations conducted by intelligence services.</part81>
        <part82>You can interact with factions and parties. You can start supporting a faction, and its number of supporters will gradually increase. {0} Under certain conditions and corresponding doctrines, you can ban an unwanted faction, but that doesn’t mean its supporters will disappear immediately. Some may even seek to legalize it.</part82>

        <part83>Doctrines reflect the state's policy in a particular area. {0} Doctrines are divided into three major blocks: diplomatic, economic, and domestic political.</part83>
        <part84>Click on any of the presented doctrines.</part84>
        
        <part85>This is the doctrine window. Each doctrine has several options that can be found in multiple branches. {0}A checkbox indicates the current doctrine option. Available options for change are highlighted in white. Gradually, you will unlock more advanced options in the branches as the player progresses through the game.</part85>
        <part86>Click on any of the doctrine values except the current one.</part86>
        <part87>The conditions for transitioning to the selected doctrine option are listed below.</part87>
        <part88>At the top is the description of the answer option and its impact on the country's parameters.</part88>
        <part89>Scroll through the description and click the voting button.</part89>
        <part90>The game features 4 voting systems. All of them are related to the doctrine "Legislative Right".{0}1. Sole Dictatorship. All laws are passed by the player. The opinions of factions or politicians are not considered. More political capital is spent on changing the doctrine.{0}2. Party Oligarchy. The strength of all supporting and opposing politicians regarding the change of doctrine is compared.{0}3. Representative Democracy. The number of a particular faction in the representative body is checked.{0}4. Direct Democracy. The transition to a particular doctrine option depends on the country's parameters (Strength of Radical Opposition, Unity of Opinions, Civic Activity).</part90>

        <part91>Interaction with politicians is available in the game, which is one of the core mechanics.</part91>
        <part92>The number of politicians in the pool is always limited. Over time, politicians will lose influence or die, and new ones will replace them. Politicians representing national republics leave the pool if their republic separates from the player's country.</part92>
        <part93>Each politician has a card that contains basic information about them.</part93>

        <ending1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The people did not come out in your support.

        <ending2var0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Citizens did not come out in your support.

After the blockade of the government quarter and the seizure of parliament by protesters, state security forces and officials went over to the side of the rebels. You were arrested and shot by decision of a tribunal consisting mainly of your former comrades. The new government launched a program of large-scale reforms. Soon Russia declared independence, and other republics followed. Apparently, the days of the union treaty are numbered.</ending2var1>
        <ending3var0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Having taken refuge in a bunker in advance and evacuated the population under the guise of an exercise, you pressed the treasured red button. The Americans, noticing the launch, responded. It is unknown whether America survived, but contact with satellites was lost. It is dangerous to go to the surface due to radiation, and communication is now carried out by old wired telephones in an underground system of bunkers, where we have hidden as many of our citizens as capacity allows. But is this brave new world the one we fought for?</ending3var0>
        <ending3var1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@However, when you decided to launch nuclear weapons, the security officers, in agreement with the military, quickly changed the missile launch codes.

        <ending4 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Chinese troops managed to defeat our army, and then cross the border and fortify themselves on the peaks in the area of lakes Khasan and Khanka. Under pressure from the state apparatus, you had to sign an agreement on reconciliation and delimitation of territories, transferring part of the land to the Chinese. After this, you had to announce your resignation and retirement from politics.|@A few months later, on the orders of the new leader of the country, a criminal case was opened against you for corruption and abuse of power.</ending4>
        <ending5 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@You lost the election. Don’t despair, because you are the first person in Russian history who managed to do this. After losing power, you withdrew from political activity and created your own non-profit organization "{0}-fund", which conducts research on the history of your reign. Perhaps in this way you wanted to justify yourself, but, however, no one cares anymore... </ending5>

        <ending6var0_0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After extensive criticism of your policies, the Plenum of the Central Committee recommended removing you from all positions and sending you into retirement. As compensation, you were assigned a personal allowance and were also given the right to remain a member of the Central Committee, but without the right to vote. Your political career is over, and an unprincipled representative of the nomenklatura, controlled by a handful of the highest party oligarchy, has come to power.</ending6var0_0>
        <ending6var0_1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After abundant criticism of your policies, the Plenum of the Central Committee recommended that you be removed from all positions and sent to an insignificant position in Siberia.

        <ending6var1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After much criticism of your policies, {0} initiated a vote to begin impeachment against the current head of state. You were accused of large-scale corruption and abuse of power, and, as a result of the investigation, were removed from office.|The court sentenced you to 15 years in prison, but several years later, after numerous appeals, it decided to dismiss all charges for lack of evidence. You were freed again, but you no longer took any part in politics.</ending6var1>

        <ending7var0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Under pressure from the conspirators, you had to resign. Unsuccessful reforms carried out after the coup led to a socio-political crisis and economic collapse. The state continued to exist, but reached pre-crisis levels only by the beginning of the 2010s.

        <ending8 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@You thought to avoid unnecessary conflicts, but the Plenum thought otherwise - several influential party members came to an agreement, after which during the debate they sharply criticized the party leadership. Most of the delegates supported them and you were removed from your position and replaced with a "better leader" from among the leading faction {0}.|@You were nevertheless re-elected to the new Central Committee and even transferred to a new, albeit lower positions, but soon, it seems, will be dropped even lower.</ending8>
        <ending9var0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Foreign partners lay low in anticipation, not officially reacting to the coup. After the situation in the country stabilized, they completely recognized them as the legitimate government and continued trade contacts. Unsuccessful reforms carried out after the coup led to a socio-political crisis and economic collapse. The state continued to exist, but reached pre-crisis levels only by the beginning of the 2010s. You have received only a few dry lines in history books.</ending9var0>
        <ending9var1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The people did not come out in your support. After stabilizing the situation in the country, the putschists held fictitious elections, the results of which were recognized, including by foreign countries. Unsuccessful reforms carried out after the coup led to a socio-political crisis and economic collapse. The state continued to exist, but reached pre-crisis levels only by the beginning of the 2010s.

        <ending10 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After secession of state-forming republics from the {0}, you were accused of the collapse of the state and dismissed. The country began to experience an economic crisis and the rise of nationalism. Soon other republics accepted declarations of sovereignty and left the country.</ending10>

        <ending12 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The Government's inability to curb the financial crisis led to catastrophic consequences for the state. Subjects of {0} began to create their own monetary systems, undermining the foundations of the once unified economic space. Separatism and radical nationalism raised its head in almost all parts of the country. The new republican leaderships took a course on independence.|@With this background, the top generals and special services colluded and carried out a coup d'etat, declaring a state of emergency and austerity to save the countries. You were removed from power and soon forgotten by all.</ending12>
        <ending13 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After the ill-fated plenum of the Central Committee, all politics in the country began to be controlled by the security services, which periodically carried out purges in the party and the state apparatus. Due to constant repressions, the country faced political and economic instability, as the administrative apparatus was severely reduced. The future of such a "security regime" is unclear. The military remains inactive and the party cannot oppose this machine of repression.</ending13>
        <ending14 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Due to your short-sighted policies, almost all the republics have left the {0}, and those that remained signed an agreement transforming the {0} into the CIS, effectively overthrowing you. The {0} no longer exists, and you are left without power. You will attempt to run for president of the new Russia but will suffer a humiliating defeat, finishing near the bottom of the race. The rest of your life will be spent feeling the hatred of the entire Russian people.|@However, perhaps in a very distant future, the winds of history will mercilessly scatter the pile of debris that has accumulated on your grave.</ending14>

        <var33 autoNewLine="true">A semi-public planned economy, where maximum digitalization has occurred at an acceptable level for the modern world of scientific and technological progress. Cash is absent as a class, each citizen has electronic accounts in a single state bank, and the exchange of information and coordination between enterprises and state bodies happens almost instantly. Thanks to this, the economy gains additional flexibility: planning bodies can easily adjust economic calculations, and sovkhozes, factories and shops - not wait for bureaucratic red tape, but solve local problems among themselves through surpluses, although still following specific planning calculations requirements.</var33>
        <var34 autoNewLine="true">Private enterprises and collective farms are absent in this economy. All links of the economic chain and subjects of the economy fully and unconditionally obey the economic orders and decisions of the State Planning Committee, and fulfil all the tasks of the five-year plans. But at the same time, it is the labour collectives of economic entities that have full control over internal administrative and personnel issues, regulating them independently through internal voting. In this way, the balance between the state and the public is maintained.|The old system of planning is replaced by a system of applications: every year the relevant authorities collect information on needs, and then the planning authorities form a plan from this in the form of applications. Each enterprise and sovkhoz is obliged to determine how much of the application it can fulfil that year on the basis of its capacity. Then the state pays a share of the financing exclusively for the fulfilment of the selected share of the applications, and fines are imposed for failure to fulfil it.|In order to prevent the phenomenon of production egoism, internal overproduction is not encouraged - the products produced in excess of the application are not bought back by the state (except for agricultural products), and their free sale on the market is prohibited. The only way to sell overproduced products is to contact a special new state body, which will look for buyers from abroad. Similarly, the same body will also look for foreign suppliers in case of shortages of products or raw materials within the country.|Thus, by maintaining centralised and accountable planning without khozraschyot, the flexibility of planning and the involvement of workers in the competent management of enterprises is increased.</var34>
        <var35 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">Although the economy is command-and-administrative, the final efficiency of enterprises is evaluated not in commodity terms but in monetary terms. Thus, to achieve financial efficiency, enterprises strive to reduce costs, lower the price of goods, and find other internal opportunities to increase profitability for the state.</var35>
        <var36 autoNewLine="true">The economy is divided into 3 categories: heavily regulated sectors, sectors with soft regulation and self-management, and an unregulated sector. The first category includes state enterprises of strategically important sectors and the production of essential goods. The second category includes state enterprises of light industry and private farmers, who are encouraged to unite into cooperatives with economic benefits. And the third category includes small businesses, cooperatives, and state enterprises of low importance. This economy is primarily export-oriented and aims to generate sufficient revenue from this export to meet the needs of the population through imports.</var36>
        <var37 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">This model appeals to a specific principle of capitalist market economy development, believing that only an increase in consumption leads to production and economic growth. Based on this, the government seeks to stimulate demand by all means, resorting not only to social guarantees and benefits but also to propaganda, advertising, and government orders.</var37>
        <var38 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">This model appeals to the classical principle of capitalist market economy development, believing that minimizing state intervention and allowing a free market to function will create the best economic mechanism.</var38>
        <var39 autoNewLine="true">Sectoral planning by goals, where the center sets the main proportions of development, after which the indicators are specified by lower planning bodies. It stimulates productivity growth through regular reduction of wholesale prices for finished products, conscious incomplete allocation of resources to lower producers, and socialist competition. At the same time, it increases the burden on administrators, who have to bargain with planners for resources and prices. In the consumer sector, independent cooperatives and cooperatives relatively freely exist.</var39>
        <var40 autoNewLine="true">Chen Yun, a moderate Chinese theorist-economist, put forward the idea of a "birdcage": it is what helps the bird not fly away wherever it pleases. Thus, he called for taking advantage of the market economy, but keeping the situation under strict government control. The implementation of this policy implies a state monopoly on strategically important sectors of the economy (raw materials, heavy industry, military-industrial complex, and so on), wide and deep state regulation and intervention in the market, and state control over the entire banking sector. At the same time, in other parts of the economy, the free existence of private entrepreneurship of any kind is allowed, but the emergence of private monopolists-corporations is prevented.</var40>
        <var41 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">This model appeals to the solidarist principle of capitalist market economy development, believing that the focus should be on the most valuable and powerful market players — the so-called "national corporations," which should ensure true economic sovereignty for the state with full support from the government and state bodies. The structure of corporations also includes paternalistic principles of providing their loyal employees with all primary individual needs.</var41>
        <var42 autoNewLine="true">Under this economic policy, cooperatives, including rural ones, joint ventures with foreign capital, and state enterprises are legal. The latter are managed according to the principle called "socialist self-management" by the Yugoslav theorist Kardelj: labor collectives of enterprises are fully self-managed, including purchasing resources and finding buyers for their products, distributing profits, and determining financial expenses, and so on. The state, in turn, uses methods of decentralized indicative planning - generalized categories of planning goals, not specifying the principles and methods of their implementation.</var42>
        <var43 autoNewLine="true">Imagine a free market economy with no state property, but with state regulation, an antitrust committee, and state judiciary. Then add a ban on any private property and private entrepreneurship - and you get syndicalism: a free market of cooperatives of all kinds and sizes with a state as the guardian of fair and free competition among these cooperatives.</var43>
        <var44 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">A salary tax is theft of honestly earned labor. Charging such a tax is like taking a tithe or tribute, turning us into a mega-church or a mega-bandit.</var44>

        <var48 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">Strangely enough, but this is a flat tax scale with reverse payments: throughout the year, equal amounts of taxes are collected from all citizens, and then, at the end of the year, depending on income, the budget allocates even more to those with lower income. Thus, it results in a flat tax and progressive payments, where a poor taxpayer receives more from the budget at the end of the year than they contributed throughout the year.</var48>
        <var49 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">The amount collected under the tax varies depending on the citizen's income: the higher the income, the higher the tax.</var49>
        <var50 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">The amount collected under the tax varies depending on the citizen's income: the higher the income, the higher the tax. Along with this, there is a separate tax on luxury and large amounts of property and capital.</var50>

        <var163 autoNewLine="true">A similar system operated in the SFRY from 1968-1973. It was based on the system of 1963-1968; however, the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly was abolished, and all its powers were transferred to the Assembly of Nations. Along with this, the Organizational-Political Assembly was replaced by the Socio-Political Council, which was now elected directly by all citizens. The other three assemblies continued their functions.</var163>
        <var164 autoNewLine="true">A similar system operated in the SFRY from 1963-1968. As a result, the parliament consisted of a bicameral Federal Assembly (which included the Assembly of Nations elected from the regions) and four assemblies of labor collectives: trade-economic, social security and healthcare, cultural-educational, organizational-political. Each assembly elected deputies from representatives of the corresponding field of activity at labor meetings of their workers.</var164>

        <var169 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">Henry George's economic idea of a socialised free market with private properties, which is based on the idea that "everyone owns what they create", adheres to 5 basic principles in modern conditions: |1. No taxes except for land taxes. The amount of tax levied varies according to the purpose for which land is used: a minimum tax for personal use of land, a medium tax for agrarian purposes, and a maximum tax for other land uses. |2. Allowing exports and imports only within other societies adhering to georgism, or with a tax of 50% otherwise. |3. A minimal state concerned only with defence, diplomacy, tax collection, and ensuring the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens (in particular, guaranteed rights to personal land and equal and free access to natural resources and natural wealth for everyone). |4. Common use of land and natural resources, which means that no one has the right of private ownership of land, rivers, lakes, forests, wild animals, wild fish, natural wealth, etc., everyone has the right to extract all of the above and no one has the right to restrict another in this matter. |5. Total non-interference of the state in the market (in all other cases), refusal of the state to participate in the economy and refusal of the state ownership of any economic property.</var169>
        <var170 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">The complete elimination of cooperatives and artels, along with the reorganization of all collective farms into state farms and the transformation of peasants into rural workers, coincides with the abolition of even the smallest self-management of enterprises. All elements of economic structures and connections, from the smallest and most insignificant, are pre-calculated by the state, which may have a negative impact in the event of disasters or unexpected problems.</var170>
        <var171 autoNewLivar171ne="true" newLineChar="|">All territorial planning bodies lose their relevance and become mere formalities, while real planning powers are transferred to scientific and industrial associations, which become the new divisions of economic zones in the country instead of territorial divisions. These scientific and industrial associations are enormous state conglomerates, created by merging various enterprises, rural organizations, and educational institutions based on economic proximity. Thus, unified chains and systems of production, extraction, and personnel work are formed within each sector and sub-sector of the economy. Republican and other forms of organizations are replaced by more efficient economic associations.</var171>
        <var172 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">Doctrine is based on the most innovative U.S. Army tactics - Army Code, Command by Negation, Field Manual 100-5, Five paragraph order, Weinberger-Powell Doctrine, Sustainment Principles, Red Teams, Three Block War, and other U.S. field manuals and tactics. |The core principles are:|- Careful preparation of the operation for all outcomes and options|- Continuous provision of sufficient supplies, weapons, and equipment|- Emphasis on force mobility|- Allocation of equipment at each base to expedite the movement of soldiers from one operational location to another without ‘redundancy’|- Formation of an all-volunteer army|- Support for the initiative of commanders and officers in the field|- Continuous and comprehensive flexibility</var172>
        <var173>The doctrine of total annihilation of the enemy is based on many German tactics since the Franco-Prussian War and is centred on two main principles: victory at all costs and victory as quickly as possible. In order to realise these two principles, it is not just allowed, but recommended the total destruction of the enemy by any methods - total destruction of cities, mass ‘collateral damage’, refusal of any conventions, fear tactics, chemical weapons and so on. No pity should be shown for the enemy - the sooner they are swept away, the sooner the war will be over.</var173>

        <tech40>The proton collider in the USSR is a majestic symbol of scientific progress and the quest to unravel the fundamental mysteries of the Universe.  This complex device, designed to accelerate protons to incredible speeds and collide them to study subatomic particles and interactions occurring under extreme conditions.  The USSR proton collider enables experiments that reveal the laws of quantum physics, bringing Soviet science closer to understanding the nature of matter and energy.  This project requires colossal resources and coordination among many institutions, reflecting the collective spirit of Soviet science.  The use of superconducting magnets and advanced cooling systems creates conditions under which the behavior of particles can be studied at previously inaccessible levels.  As a result of the collider's work, scientists can discover new elementary particles, study the properties of interactions at the quantum level, and move closer to developing new technologies that can change not only science but also industry, medicine, and the energy sector of the USSR.  The proton collider symbolizes the scientific and technological superiority of the USSR, its aspiration for leadership in fundamental research, and serves as a driving force for progress in mastering the micro- and macro-world.</tech40>
        <tech41>The modernization of nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the USSR is aimed at improving their efficiency, safety, and resilience to external and internal factors.  As part of the modernization, advanced technologies are being implemented that improve reactor performance, optimize the use of nuclear fuel, and minimize waste, thereby reducing the environmental impact on the surrounding area.  Special attention is given to strengthening cooling systems and accident protection, which enhances the safety of the plants' operation.  Soviet scientists and engineers are actively developing new materials for reactor installations that are resistant to high temperatures and radiation, which allows extending the lifespan of NPPs.  In addition, automated control and monitoring systems are being implemented that track the state of all key parameters of the plant in real-time and can promptly respond to any deviations.  The modernization of NPPs also includes the use of innovative solutions for the storage and processing of spent fuel, making nuclear energy even more environmentally friendly.  These measures will allow the USSR not only to increase the share of nuclear energy in the country's energy balance but also to ensure reliable energy supply for industry and the population for decades to come.</tech41>
        <tech42>Fast neutron reactors (FNR) in the USSR are advanced next-generation installations designed to significantly enhance the efficiency of nuclear fuel utilization and address its shortage.  Unlike traditional thermal neutron reactors, FNRs utilize fast neutrons, allowing not only for effective fuel burning but also for reprocessing spent nuclear materials, including plutonium and actinides.  This makes them an important element in the long-term nuclear energy strategy of the Soviet Union.  One of the key advantages of such reactors is their ability to operate on uranium-238, which is significantly more abundant than uranium-235, thus expanding the resource base for nuclear energy.  Fast neutron reactors can create what is known as reproducible nuclear fuel, where the amount of fissile material produced exceeds the amount consumed.  The modernization and construction of such reactors will enable the USSR not only to ensure energy independence but also to enhance ecological safety by minimizing the amount of nuclear waste.  Leading research institutes in the country are actively working on FNR projects, implementing advanced materials and automated control systems, making these reactors safe and highly efficient for future generations.</tech42>
        <tech43>The experimental thermonuclear reactor in the USSR represents a key step towards mastering controlled thermonuclear fusion, which promises to become an inexhaustible source of energy for the entire country.  Its operation is based on the principle of fusing light atomic nuclei, which releases colossal energy, significantly exceeding that released in traditional nuclear reactors.  The main task is to achieve conditions under which plasma, consisting of deuterium and tritium, can be maintained in a stable state at extremely high temperatures and pressures.  Soviet scientists and engineers are creating complex magnetic traps, such as tokamaks, to control the plasma, as well as developing superconducting materials and advanced cooling systems.  This allows for the management of the thermonuclear reaction, preventing its uncontrolled development.  An important part of the experiments is studying methods for long-term plasma confinement and raising its temperature to levels necessary for fusion.  The successful implementation of a thermonuclear reactor could be a revolutionary step in the energy sector of the USSR, paving the way for a virtually limitless source of clean and safe energy.  This would allow the country to permanently solve the issues of energy independence and ecological safety, making thermonuclear energy the foundation of a new era in human history.</tech43>
        <tech44>In-depth research on quanta in the USSR opens doors to understanding the most fundamental laws of nature and allows for a new level of scientific discovery and technological progress.  At the center of this research is the study of quantum mechanics and its application to the development of advanced technologies, such as quantum computers, communication systems, and highly sensitive sensors.  Research in the field of quanta is aimed at studying the behavior of elementary particles at the subatomic level, enabling the identification and utilization of their unique properties, such as superposition and entanglement.  Soviet scientists focus on creating experimental setups for detailed analysis of quantum processes, as well as developing mathematical models that explain particle interactions under conditions close to absolute zero.  These studies are already yielding results in the form of developing quantum communications with a high level of information protection and quantum computing systems that can exponentially increase computing power compared to traditional computers.  Breakthroughs in quantum physics could provide the USSR with an advantage in areas such as cybersecurity, new types of materials and energy, and open up opportunities for creating future technologies that will radically change science and industry.</tech44>
        <tech46>Depleted uranium has high density and strength, making it an ideal material for creating armor-piercing projectiles and missile cores.  Upon impact with armor, it penetrates efficiently, causing significant damage inside the equipment.  Soviet scientists are developing munitions with consideration for minimizing radiological impact on the environment and the personnel, focusing on the safety of the production and storage of such munitions.  The use of depleted uranium enhances firepower and improves the characteristics of armor-piercing rounds, significantly increasing the effectiveness of Soviet troops on the battlefield.  These munitions play a strategic role in enhancing the potential of ground forces and also provide an additional advantage in local conflicts, where enemy armored vehicles may be one of the main obstacles to victory.  Combined with thoughtful tactics and advanced guidance systems, depleted uranium munitions become an important element of the defense power of the USSR.</tech46>
        <tech47>Neutron warheads in the USSR represent a specific type of nuclear weapon designed to maximize the impact on the enemy's personnel while minimizing damage to infrastructure.  Their operation is based on the principle of releasing a powerful stream of neutrons during a nuclear explosion, which penetrates armor and protective structures, affecting people and electronic systems, while leaving buildings and equipment relatively unharmed.  Soviet science pays special attention to developing warheads that can be effectively used at a tactical level, including for the defense of strategic facilities or deterring attacks by large mechanized formations of the enemy.  The technologies used in the production of such munitions include the use of special nuclear materials and advanced detonation systems, which allow for controlling the range and power of damage from neutron radiation.  Neutron warheads become an element of asymmetric strategic balance, allowing the USSR to maintain an advantage in the event of intense conflicts, where it is important to inflict damage on the enemy while minimizing destruction, especially in densely populated or industrially developed areas.  The introduction of such weapons requires strict control and well-thought-out tactics of use for maximum effectiveness in defensive and offensive operations.</tech47>
        <tech48>Moving at speeds exceeding 5-6 Mach (over 6,000 km/h), these blocks can perform sharp maneuvers, making them virtually invulnerable to interception by conventional air defense and missile defense systems.  Soviet engineers focus on creating new types of thermal protection materials that allow combat blocks to withstand the enormous temperatures generated during hypersonic speeds in the atmosphere.  An important part of the development is the autonomous guidance system, which ensures high accuracy in hitting targets, even during sharp changes in trajectory.  Hypersonic combat blocks strengthen the nuclear and strategic potential of the USSR, guaranteeing the delivery of warheads to any point on the planet with minimal chances of interception.  These technologies place the country at the forefront of the arms race, providing it with a powerful tool for deterrence and demonstrating military power.</tech48>
        <tech49>Strike combat UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in the USSR are becoming a key element of modern combat strategies, providing high mobility and operational capability to strike targets without direct risk to the lives of crews.  These drones are equipped with advanced navigation systems, allowing them to operate autonomously or under remote control in complex combat conditions, including areas with dense air defense.  Soviet engineers are developing strike UAVs capable of carrying various types of weaponry—from precision missiles to small-caliber bombs.  The use of such drones gives the army the ability to deliver pinpoint strikes against key targets, suppressing the enemy's personnel and equipment, as well as destroying infrastructure.  Special attention is paid to increasing flight range, autonomy, and the ability to remain in the air for extended periods for reconnaissance and immediate strike capabilities.  Strike UAVs become an important element in the arsenal of the USSR Armed Forces, enhancing their combat capabilities in local conflicts and operations in remote regions.  The introduction of these technologies changes the nature of warfare, providing new tools for controlling airspace and rapid response to threats.</tech49>
        <tech30>The development of new heavy machinery</tech30>
        <tech45>The modernization of launch vehicles</tech45>
        <tech50>The SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), also known as "Star Wars," was a long-term military space program announced by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983. Its main goals included the military dominance in space: the creation of a space-based missile defense "shield" capable of intercepting and destroying ballistic missiles and their warheads at all stages of flight, as well as a system of space satellites capable of destroying any space objects, including foreign satellites.||The development of missile interceptors ERIS (Exoatmospheric Reentry Interceptor Subsystem) and HEDI (High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor) was soon initiated.||The ERIS missile was developed by Lockheed and was designed to intercept warheads in space at closing speeds of up to 13.4 km/s. Samples of the missile were manufactured based on the stages of solid-fueled ICBMs, guidance was carried out using an infrared sensor and the damaging element was an inflatable hexagonal structure with weights placed at the corners: this system provided the same damage area as the HOE "umbrella" with a much lower mass.||HEDI, developed by McDonnell Douglas, was a small close-range interceptor missile designed for combating space objects.</tech50>
        <tech51>The "Brilliant Pebbles" project is also part of the SDI program, but in the form of space-based laser weapons rather than missiles.||It proposed placing a system of more than 4,000 miniature satellites equipped with autonomous laser guidance systems into low Earth orbit. Each satellite, weighing 14 kg, was to be aimed at ballistic missiles rising from the atmosphere or any other space and orbital objects, including foreign satellites and to strike them head-on at a closing speed of about 10-15 km/s.||The main advantage of the system was its relative cheapness and difficulty of destruction for a preemptive strike by the enemy. The system consisted of thousands of tiny satellites spread tens and hundreds of kilometers apart. Considering the complexity of tracking such small objects, the enemy could physically not destroy a significant number of them in a reasonable time: however, losses could be replenished fairly quickly. Standard methods of blinding and jamming the system would also be ineffective due to the significant number of satellites and the lack of integration of the system into other components of the SDI.</tech51>
        <tech52>The family of heavy-class launch vehicles with reusable first stages significantly reduces the costs of conducting space and military space programs. The launch vehicle consists of two stages and uses kerosene (fuel) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer) as fuel components.||The first stage of the launch vehicle can be reused, and it is equipped with equipment for return and vertical landing on a landing pad or floating platform.||After accelerating the second stage with the payload, the first stage shuts down its engines and separates at an altitude of about 70 km, approximately 2.5 minutes after the launch of the launch vehicle. After separation, the first stage of the launch vehicle maneuvers slightly away from the exhaust of the second stage's engine using an orientation system and turns its engines forward to prepare for three main braking maneuvers: the impulse for transitioning to a reverse course, the impulse for entering the atmosphere, and the landing impulse.</tech52>
        <tech53>"Constellation" is a comprehensive project aimed at developing new space technology and planning the creation of the necessary infrastructure to ensure flights to the Moon and establish a permanent base there.||The "Constellation" development program includes:|- a new crewed exploration spacecraft "Orion";|- a heavy launch vehicle "Ares-1" to place the crewed exploration spacecraft into orbit around the Earth;|- a super-heavy launch vehicle "Ares-5" for launching the spacecraft beyond low Earth orbit and other payloads;|- a lunar module "Altair" designed for landing on the Moon and taking off from its surface.||The "Constellation" program proposes a separate launch of the crewed spacecraft and the lunar module, their docking in low Earth orbit, a flight to lunar orbit, separation, and the crew's landing on the Moon in the lunar module. The orbital spacecraft remains in orbit around the Moon in automatic mode during this time.</tech53>
        <tech54>"Prometheus" is a NASA program aimed at developing a nuclear propulsion system for spacecraft.||This system is to consist of an ion engine and a compact atomic reactor that supplies power to the engine. The required reactor power is expected to be 250 kilowatts. The ion engine should generate thrust of about 60 grams, but it needs to operate continuously. This allows for a significant reduction in flight time to the distant planets of the Solar System.||The main plans of the program include:|- increasing electricity generation in space;|- increasing the durability of spacecraft;|- increasing the range of flight and power of the propulsion system;|- additional power for high-speed data transmission;|- exploration of Jupiter's moons - Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto;</tech54>
        <tech55>When old ideas have been rejected, and the new ones that have replaced them turn out to be false gods. When despite all sincere faith, reality does not come to life. Then contradictions arise. And sooner or later, they can no longer be ignored. And when this happens, those blissfully cornered by their own sincerity create anew in their inability to resolve the antinomy of the existence they perceive. The Ouroboros closes, and everything begins again.||Blessed are the hungry. Blessed are the mourners. Blessed are the believers.|Credo, quia absurdum est.</tech55>
        <tech56 autoNewLine="true" newLineChar="|">When the romantic breath of modernism had evaporated and the images it formed became too similar to reality, truism was replaced by a new set of philosophical views that greedily pushed the images further away from the sickening reality.||The creator died, and reality died with him. The very notion of truth was rejected by the dead. And nothingness was mirrored in everyone's mind by images of the desirable. The thing-in-itself took on the guise of the thing-in-nothing. And drove its spearhead into the underbelly of the remaining shards of reality.||The god is dead. The creator is dead. The world is dead.|Mortuos plango.</tech56>        <!--American 5-->
        <tech57>In 1984, a serious competitor emerged for the closed American military-scientific network ARPANET: the National Science Foundation of the USA established an extensive inter-university network NSFNet, which was composed of smaller networks and had much greater capacity than ARPANET.||The first step was the development of the IRC protocol, which enabled real-time communication (chat). Then the concept of the World Wide Web was born, within which the HTTP protocol, HTML language, and URI identifiers were developed.||Following this, the ARPANET ceased to exist, having completely lost the competition to NSFNet. That same year, the first connection to the internet via a phone line (the so-called "dialup") was recorded.||The World Wide Web became publicly available, and NSFNet returned to its role as a research network. Internet traffic routing was now managed by internet service providers rather than the supercomputers of the National Science Foundation.||The internet brought together most of the existing networks at that time. The merger appeared especially attractive due to the lack of a single authority and the openness of the internet's technical standards, which made the networks independent of businesses and specific companies.</tech57>
        <tech58>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine of the USA are set to recommend two types of GM crops: insect-resistant (containing genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis) and herbicide-resistant, which kill weeds. These modifications are primarily recommended for corn, soybeans, cotton, canola, sugar beets, alfalfa, papaya, squash, and potatoes—more than 40 percent of farms in the USA grow these products.||GM crops of both types generally yield more harvest and income, but this figure varies depending on the geography of cultivation, local pests and weeds, and cultivation methods. A certain benefit comes from the fact that products from insect-resistant grains are less contaminated with insecticides.||Agriculture is an important sector of the U.S. economy, which is a net exporter of food products. About one-third of U.S. farmland is planted for the export of agricultural products.</tech58>
        <tech59>State control over morality is losing its effectiveness as society changes toward the atomization of the individual, the cultivation of nonconformism, and the dominance of universal utilitarianism. In such a situation, direct state intervention becomes ineffective and often leads to the destabilization of public order.||A natural solution for post-industrial states is the formation of quasi-public organizations that exercise "public" oversight and control over society, condemning and approving norms of human behavior, adjusting and establishing new general lines of morality. The gradual transfer of moral control into the hands of activists is accompanied by the preservation of the political and economic influence of state elites over the largest of these organizations, allowing them to indirectly dictate order from greater to lesser, continuing to "keep a finger on the pulse" of society.||Thus, even the most ardent destroyers of morality simply create a new one, actively including themselves in the pantheon of an updated version of what they condemn.||Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt.</tech59>

        <pol0>In agreement with the moderates and reformers, and relying on Andropov's cadres in the Politburo and the KGB, the youngest member of the Party leadership, Mikhail Gorbachev, convened the Central Committee plenum with phenomenal speed. His rivals had no time to react - Romanov was on vacation in Palanga and isolated from information from Moscow, and Shcherbitsky, who was in New York, could not return in time because his plane was deliberately delayed. In the absence of his opponents, Gorbachev successfully carried out a legal coup.</pol0>
        <pol1>Gorbachev's conspiracy failed: Gromyko refused to support his candidacy, despite pressure from his own son. Shcherbitsky, warned by his people in the Central Committee apparatus, managed to return from the USA. Having united the conservative-moderate faction, they nominated Viktor Grishin to the General Secretary of the Central Committee as a guarantor of maintaining the course towards the stability of developed socialism. Gorbachev had to retreat, and the Plenum of the Central Committee elected Grishin as head of the party.</pol1>
        <pol2>Realizing that Gorbachev was unlikely to be able to reform the Soviet Union properly, Andrei Gromyko refused to support him and, overpowering his desire to retire honorably, nominated himself for the position of General Secretary. No one dared to speak out against such an authoritative and experienced politician, and Gromyko was unanimously elected head of the party. However, the 76-year-old patriarch of Soviet politics has serious health issues and will soon clearly become a new participant in the "coffin carriage race"...</pol2>
        <pol3>Being the leader of the only legally registered opposition all-Union party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky was also one of the few oppositionists who supported the State Emergency Committee. The new leadership of the country, demonstrating loyalty to the principles of Perestroika and political pluralism, with the support of the Chairman of the Supreme Council Lukyanov, decided to co-opt Zhirinovsky into the State Emergency Committee, and then to appoint him "Chairman of the State Emergency Committee" - in the hope that the charismatic leader would be able to lead the USSR out of the crisis.</pol3>
        <pol4>The August events worsened Yanaev's health, and he was hospitalized. In accordance with the Constitution, Anatoly Lukyanov, Chairman of the Supreme Council, became the next acting President of the USSR. A longtime friend of Gorbachev and a supporter of Perestroika, he nevertheless entered into a confrontation with Gorbachev in the summer of 1991 and now intends to present a democratic socialist alternative to the old policies.</pol4>
        <pol5>The proactive Minister of Internal Affairs of the USSR and the former head of the Latvian Communist Party, Boris Pugo is better suited than anyone else to govern a multinational country in such difficult times when determination and political will are required. The members of the State Emergency Committee, realizing this, decided to entrust the leadership of the USSR to him, appointing him to the specially established position of "Chairman of the State Emergency Committee".</pol5>
        <pol6>Being afraid of a highly possible victory for Gorbachev, who was too close to reformist circles, Grigory Romanov decided to postpone his vacation and agreed with Gromyko and Shcherbitsky that in the event of Chernenko’s death, they would support his nomination in exchange for allowing moderate reforms while steadily maintaining the socialist system of the USSR and continuing the current foreign policy course. Finding himself in the minority, Gorbachev did not go for the position of General Secretary, and the Plenum of the Central Committee elected Romanov as head of the party.</pol6>
        <pol7>Thanks to a happy coincidence (his guard ate the shoddy smoked fish), Konstantin Chernenko escaped getting toxicoinfection in August 1983, continuing to govern the Soviet Union not from the ward of the Central Clinical Hospital, but from his office in the Kremlin. However, the 73-year-old Secretary General’s lung disease is progressing, and he realizes that he does not have long to live. What will he have time to do during this time?</pol7>
        <pol8>After the death of his political opponent Andropov, Vladimir Shcherbitsky took advantage of the situation and successfully framed his nominee Chebrikov, convincing Chernenko to return the loyal Fedorchuk to the position of Chairman of the KGB. Having all the power of the state security agencies behind him, Shcherbitsky was able to gain enough political influence that after Chernenko’s death that neither Gorbachev nor Romanov nominated themselves, but also supported his candidacy for the position of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU.</pol8>
        <pol9>As Vice-President of the USSR, Gennady Yanaev is the only person in the country who could legitimately assume the powers of head of state. Now, when the State Emergency Committee announced the impossibility for health reasons of Gorbachev’s further fulfillment of his duties as President of the USSR, this burden fell on the shoulders of Yanaev, an indecisive person who also suffered from a nervous system disease. Won't this play a cruel joke on the country?..</pol9>

    <scenario_desc>
        <USSR1985>«The Five-Year Funeral» culminates into the beginning of some new stage in the country's history, but no one can yet say what kind. The Soviet people are waiting for changes, but at the same time they believe that the government will be able to keep all the good things and get rid of only the bad. Several groups have joined the struggle for power, using all possible legal methods of struggle to defeat their opponents in order to start implementing their programme for the future of the Soviet Union. And how will it end?</USSR1985>
        <USSR1991>It was clear that Perestroika had ended in utter failure: rising deficits, separatism, ethnic strife and foreign debt, together with the loss of almost the entire foreign policy sphere of influence, threatened the collapse of the Soviet Union. Outraged by President Gorbachev's helplessness and constant compromises, his associates set up a State Emergency Committee and decided to take full power into their own hands to try to save the country. But their irresoluteness and fear of the threat of civil war could lead to the rapid collapse of a recently so powerful state.</USSR1991>

        <events5Desc0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@In the USSR, anti-alcohol campaigns of various scales were repeatedly initiated and carried out by the authorities. The latest campaign took place during the reign of Yuri Andropov, when severe penalties for drinking alcohol at work became part of a set of measures to strengthen discipline. Although at the same time the production of the cheapest Soviet vodka, Moskovskaya, began with an initial cost of 4 Roubles and 70 kopecs, nicknamed 'Andropovka' by the grateful people. However, drunkenness in the country has acquired catastrophic proportions: on average, over the past decades, alcohol consumption has increased to 10 liters per year per person (and even more when taking illegal moonshine into account).|@The party most zealously advocates for the need for a new anti-alcohol campaign by {0} and {1}. When he was the first secretary of the Tomsk regional committee, {2}, not without success, strove to turn the city into an exemplary "sobriety zone". Now {2} and {3} want to "fight drunkenness," considering it one of the main reasons for the stagnation of the Soviet economy. They propose to annually reduce vodka production by 10%, organize temperance societies throughout the country and limit the sale of alcohol.|@Other party members propose returning to the experience of Brezhnev’s campaigns, which consisted of increasing prices for high-proof alcohol and reducing its production in exchange for increasing the production of wine and beer.|@However, the Council of Ministers is against the campaign, since there is simply nothing to close the budget hole that is created by a sharp reduction in revenues. The ministers propose to limit ourselves only with strengthening anti-alcohol propaganda.|@In any case, we can follow in Andropov’s footsteps and become a "folk hero" by making vodka even cheaper.</events5Desc0>

In a very difficult international situation, we must be on alert and minimize possible provocations from Western opponents, who are ready to attack the authority of our country at any moment.|@In order to avoid possible conflicts, some party members propose to take measures to protect citizens from the possible harmful influence of foreigners. However, as the practice of previous Soviet "mega-events" has shown, bans usually lead to a diametrically opposite result and give rise to false accusations about the democracy of our system.</events10Desc>

        <!--Ивент 11: Всемирный фестиваль молодежи и студентов: лозунг-->
        <events11Title>World Festival of Youth and Students: slogan</events11Title>

        <events11Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The initial objectives of the World Festival of Youth and Students were the struggle for peace, for the rights of youth, for the independence of peoples, and the promotion of internationalism. Communist, socialist and religious organizations took an active part in the festivals. Representatives of a wide range of youth organizations opposing fascism and military dictatorships came to the festival. Representatives of radical leftist organizations, including those outlawed in their countries, were allowed to participate. Particular attention was paid to the issue of the inadmissibility of the revival of fascism and the incitement of a new world war. Now it’s the time to have the XII World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow. What will its slogan be?</events11Desc>

        <add11Num0>However, the festival did not pass without incident. The report on the work of the Student Council at the Festival-85 reported on cases when representatives of student youth from abroad, during various festival events, put forward the thesis "about the equal responsibility of the two superpowers for the arms race", and condemned "Soviet intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan" , which was given a "decisive rebuff".</add11Num0>
        <add11Num1>However, the festival did not pass without incident. The final report of the youth organization of the Festival-85 states: during official events, simultaneous interpreters stopped translating the speeches of those speakers who contained anti-Soviet statements, which caused protests from delegates from Germany, Norway, Sweden and even Poland.</add11Num1>
        <add11Num2>The final report of the youth organization notes the brilliant organization of measures to prevent possible Western provocations: the vigilantes, together with the police, tried in every possible way to "separate our own from the strangers" and prevent free communication between foreigners and domestic youth who had not passed a special selection. Our special services managed to "nip in the bud" all the beginnings of anti-Soviet political discussions among foreigners. In addition to Soviet guides and translators, about 1 thousand accompanying persons - experienced Komsomol workers from different regions of the Soviet Union - were assigned to foreign delegations and groups. In addition, to assist law enforcement agencies in ensuring order at festival events and preventing unwanted incidents, operational Komsomol vigilante detachments with a total number of over 35 thousand people were brought in. In the Western press, the 1985 World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow was called "political theater", designed to dramatize support for the Soviet Union on the part of "healthy and beautiful young people around the world" in order not only to "calm down the Soviet audience", but also to "attract receptive hearts abroad".</add11Num2>

In addition, the WFDY accused us of trying to dilute the anti-imperialist orientation of the event, as well as of inviting representatives of far-right parties from a number of European countries to it.</events11Result2>

To preserve the honor of the party and its good name, {1} you must resign immediately.</events15Adds1>
        <events15Adds2 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@It is impossible not to see that the opponents of socialism, especially the active enemies of socialism, are speculatively using the difficulties experienced by the country and the people in order to persuade hesitant people to take the anti-socialist path, that is, the path of capitalism. They are being played along by the current General Secretary of the Central Committee, who is pursuing an opportunist policy and wants to destroy our monolithic party. I believe that {1} should immediately resign, and the Plenum of the Central Committee should appoint a new General Secretary as soon as possible.</events15Adds2>

Many issues are resolved subjectively, incorrectly, he himself does not notice it, he only enjoys his power. He has no modesty, but only an exorbitant lust for power. He exalts his cult through the press, radio, television - he sees it all, but does not stop it. This can no longer be tolerated; we cannot imagine what will happen to the party if {1} continues to serve as General Secretary. He should resign.</events15Adds3>

The inconsistency of the current policy leads to a loss of confidence in the party, discrediting perestroika and democratization. {1} can no longer control the situation in the country and the party, maintain the required pace of transformation, therefore I believe that the continuation of reforms is incompatible with his continued tenure as General Secretary. The country must be led by a person who can achieve a radical change in reforms and lead the country out of the abyss of the crisis. </events15Adds5>

        <events32Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@After the death of Stalin and the beginning of de-Stalinization, the party leaders faced the question of legal and civil rehabilitation of the defendants of the Moscow trials, including the process of the "right-Trotskyist bloc".|@For review of the court decisions, a commission was created under the chairmanship of Nikolai Shvernik, which presented evidence of unjustified mass repressions and other gross violations of socialist legality during the period of the personality cult. The commission developed a concept of repression characteristic of the political moment of that time. Participants in the trial were accused of deviating from the general line of the party in 1929 and capitulating to kulak-capitalist elements, but it was emphasized that the leaders of the "right" already in the early 1930s moved away from their positions, recognized the correctness of the party line and continued to occupy responsible government positions. Thus, all the blame for illegal repressions was placed on Stalin and the NKVD, and the party remained pure and innocent. At the same time, the results of collectivization and industrialization were not subject to criticism and doubt, and factionalism was still considered a schismatic phenomenon.|@However, after Khrushchev’s resignation, the policy of rehabilitation was put to an end, and the new leadership left the previous assessment, adjusting and removing from it the most odious accusations of espionage and preparation of assassinations of Soviet leaders. However, since the mid-1970s, after the publication of a biography of Bukharin authored by the American Sovietologist Steven Cohen, a movement in support of the rehabilitation of Bukharin began to gain popularity in the West. In his work, he presents Bukharin’s system of ideas as "Bukharinism", a real alternative to the "Great Turning Point", based not on emergency measures in the economy, but on the harmonious "growing of capitalism into socialism".|@Now is the best moment to turn to history our recent past, given that in Bukharin’s theoretical views on the NEP and cooperative socialism we can find support for current reforms.</events32Desc>

A biography written by Cohen has also been published. The official rehabilitation of Bukharin was a spark to a rethinking of his role in Soviet historical science, where the continuity of Bukharin with Lenin is especially emphasized. At the same time, the description of Bukharin given by the first Soviet leader in his will as "the favorite of the party" and "the most valuable theoretician of the party" is complemented by the fact that by the end of the 1920s he was able to overcome his partly "scholastic" and not entirely "dialectical" views. Thus, Bukharin became the deserved and only successor of Lenin and the continuator of his course and spoke from Leninist positions, both against Trotsky and against Stalin.|@The broad civil rehabilitation of Bukharin, supported by both his relatives and public organizations, did not remain without influence on public opinion. In accordance with a public opinion poll conducted among Muscovites on the popularity of Soviet politicians of the past (Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Stalin, Bukharin and Trotsky were offered to choose from), it turned out that Bukharin stood at the very top of the popularity scale by a wide margin, while Stalin and Brezhnev were at the top of the popularity scale.</events32Result0>

Kaganovich, on behalf and for the benefit of the Jewish community, carried out repression against the Soviet peoples, destroyed the peasantry and its traditional ways of life, and then, at the behest of the Zionists, established a temporary headquarters for world Jewry - in Birobidzhan. It was under the influence of Kaganovich that the USSR recognised Israel after the war.|@It was only in 1949 that Stalin managed to strike a blow against Zionism by destroying the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, but the Zionists caught up with the ‘leader of the peoples’, slowly but systematically destroying or recruiting Stalin's closest ‘associates’.

However, its success is built entirely on segregation and discrimination. After the end of the Second World War, the National Party came to power in the Republic of South Africa, which for the past decades has pursued a policy of "apartheid" - racial segregation and discrimination against the indigenous population by the white minority. In addition to complete separation in economic, social and domestic spheres, special reservations - "bantustans" - were created for the black population, where representatives of one nationality were to live. Opposition in the form of the local Communist Party and the African National Congress was severely persecuted. ANC leader Nelson Mandela has been in prison for the past 20 years. The international community has imposed all sorts of sanctions and restrictions on South Africa since the late 1950s, forcing the country's leadership to abandon its own nuclear programme. Due to the country's growing isolation, the ruling party split into several opposing groups. "Verlichte" or the "enlightened", representatives of the large industrial bourgeoisie, embarrassed by the economic and international costs of apartheid, advocated a relative liberalisation of the regime. "Ferkrampte" or "hardliners", who fought for the interests of white farming, continued to insist on maintaining the old course. |@In the late 1950s, the country was led by a "Verlichte" supporter, Peter Bona, who had to make certain political reforms. These consisted of a tricameral parliament with separate chambers for whites, coloureds and Indians.

In addition, the most odious apartheid laws, such as the ban on mixed marriages, were repealed. |@The reforms caused a split in the National Party. A far-right radical wing, led by Andris Treurnicht, split from it and founded the Conservative Party. |@Despite the Reagan administration's favourable attitude towards the anti-communism of the NP regime, the United States did impose sanctions on South Africa.

        <events62Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Russia has not been fortunate with reformers. All the great reforms either ended in failure or were excessively harsh in their implementation. An aura of such a "failed reformer" and "Russia's last hope" has formed around the figure of Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin.|@A nobleman by birth, Stolypin made a brilliant career in just a few years – from governor of a small provincial town to head of the government. His meteoric rise was facilitated by the First Russian Revolution. Having established himself as a successful "pacifier of the revolution," Stolypin was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, and after the dissolution of the First State Duma, he also became head of the government.|@In this position, he successfully "calmed" the country after several years of unrest and began the most large-scale reform in the past 50 years, which, in his view, was supposed to "turn the Russian peasant into an American farmer." However, he was unable to fully realize his ideas. In September 1911, Stolypin was shot dead by a terrorist at the Kyiv Opera House.|@Historians point out that Stolypin's attempts to destroy the peasant commune and solve the "agrarian relocation" problem through migration policy to the eastern part of the country ended in failure. Some see the causes of the reform's failure in the outbreak of war, while others blame the revolution. In this context, Stolypin's own words seem prophetic: "Give the state twenty years of peace, both internal and external, and you will not recognize today's Russia!" Peace was indeed elusive for Russia, but it has become unrecognizable.|@It is now more important than ever for us to understand – who was Stolypin? A great reformer who could have saved Russia from a bloody war and revolution? Or a great national figure who sought to modernize the country and make Russia the most influential world power, but was thwarted by "internal enemies"? Or was the domestic historiography of recent decades right in branding him as a "hangman," drowning the Russian revolution in blood in the interests of the landowners?</events62Desc>

"There is nothing good in that, of course," said the leader of {0}, but he urged that such actions be viewed in their historical context.|@He also reminded the audience that 18,000 Russians suffered at the hands of terrorists at that time. "Stolypin believed that harsh measures against people who destabilized the state were justified for that period," said the head of government. "I hope that future generations will distinguish between the blood on a doctor's hands and the blood on a hangman's hands," he quoted Stolypin.|@The head of state also evaluated Stolypin's reforms: "Thanks to these reforms, Russia became the world leader in economic growth rates." A clear indicator of the success of Stolypin's reforms, he added, was that butter produced by peasant migrants in Siberia brought more revenue to the treasury than gold sales.|@In conclusion, {2} noted that Stolypin's reforms represented "a balance of state and societal interests, based not on the dictates of power, but on encouragement, incentives, and cooperation."|@Many historians and politicians interpreted the speech of the head of state as a "call to action" and immediately began praising the former "hangman".</events62Result0>

He emphasized that "Stolypin’s figure is at the crossroads of all of Russia's struggles." "His duty as a statesman compelled him to ruthlessly suppress uprisings while channeling moral strength towards renewing the country. He took over a state in disarray and chaos – and worked to rebuild it. He gave everything to his cause, following his path with heart, mind, and life," said the head of state.|@Summing up, {2} noted that Stolypin and his policies "could have saved Russia from the woes of war and revolution," but this was thwarted by "internal enemies" and "the stubbornness of the last Tsar."|@Many historians and politicians took the leader's speech as a "call to action" and immediately began praising the former "hangman." However, not everyone was pleased with the speech.

        <events68Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@A week ago, a postal-baggage train arrived at the distant platform of Moscow station, which included a special carriage for transporting convicts. In the carriage, besides the prisoners, there were eight military personnel guarding them and one civilian. Upon arrival, no one exited the carriage. During inspection, eight bodies were found inside. One of the guards, Private Arturas Sakaulauskas, was missing. Five pistols and five spare magazines were also missing from the weapons locker.|@After three days of searching, Sakaulauskas was detained in a small provincial town. All the guards' pistols were found with him. When asked by the investigator why he killed all his comrades, Sakaulauskas responded: "They forced me to kill them."|@The details of the investigation revealed that during the journey, Sakaulauskas's comrades had repeatedly humiliated him and he could not take it anymore.|@Three options for further action in the investigation are now being considered.</events68Desc>

        <events68Result0 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The tragedy that occurred led to a rise in public outrage over the phenomenon of "hazing" in the army. Because of this, the government announced a reduction in the term of conscription, which should undermine the established hierarchical relations among servicemen. Although the reduction of the conscription period was welcomed by conscripts, the general staff was dissatisfied with the reduction in the army's combat readiness and the undermining of discipline.</events68Result0>
        <events68Result1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@Military commissariats responsible for conscription received huge state investments. Thanks to modern computers, it was possible to overcome bureaucratic chaos and paperwork in military administration bodies, which will allow a more flexible and transparent "sorting" of conscripts by military units. It is predicted that this will undermine the established hierarchical relationships among servicemen, at least to some extent.</events68Result1>
        <events68Result2 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The Criminal Code was amended with changes to the article on "violations of the statutory rules of relations between servicemen in the absence of a subordinate relationship between them." The minimum sentence for "hazing" was increased from two years to eight and the maximum from twelve to twenty-five. It is hard to say how this change will affect relations among servicemen, as the military does not like to "air their dirty laundry."</events68Result2>
        <events68Result3 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The country's major newspapers published articles detailing the "Sakalauskas case." All the blame for the tragedy was placed on the military leadership, which allowed the "moral decay of the army."

However, despite all this, an important issue for society, which had previously been ignored, was raised. The influence of the media may continue to draw attention to this problem.</events68Result3>

        <events76Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The 27th Congress of the CPSU is approaching. For the past five years, the brightest minds of our party have been working on creating a new CPSU program. The current program was adopted in 1961 at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU. At that time, Khrushchev proclaimed the goal of creating the material-technical base of communism by 1980. Unfortunately, communism has not arrived, but the program, despite minor adjustments, remains the same, irritating the enemies of socialism with premature promises made by previous Soviet leaders.|@Now that the priorities of the party and state are changing, there is a need for a new program. Naturally, there is no consensus on what should be included and what can be promised.|@Some propose restoring the characterization of the modern era as a struggle between socialism and capitalism. Others insist on "postponing" the prospect of communism and focusing on "perfecting the socialist system." There are even those who deny the existence of socialism in the Soviet Union.

The first section of the program contains an extensive critique of capitalism as a "dying, backward formation" that brings wars and threats to all humanity by its very existence. The rest of the program outlines the advantages of socialism over capitalism and as before sets the goal of building a communist society.|@Overall, despite the fact that the provisions on the country's internal development remained mostly unchanged, the focus of the program shifted from peaceful coexistence between capitalism and socialism to the confrontation between the two systems.</events76Result0>
        <events76Result1 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@As a result, the party's program underwent significant changes compared to the one that had existed for the past 25 years. The main goal of the party became "the improvement of the socialist system," and among the primary tasks were the further democratization of society and the deepening of socialist self-governance by the people. The construction of communism was once again postponed indefinitely.</events76Result1>
        <events76Result2 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@It was ultimately decided not to change the main provisions of the old party program, but only to clarify them.

        <events76Result3 autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The program text included a thesis that completely undermines the previous work of several generations of Soviet ideologists.

Primarily, this includes speculation, currency operations, private entrepreneurship, private transportation and bribery.|@Despite the state's desperate efforts to eradicate this phenomenon, the problem has not been fully eliminated. Moreover, many people who engaged in part-time work during their free time — such as construction, apartment repairs, tutoring and selling crops — often fell under the law's scope.|@The Government is now proposing a decree "On Measures to Strengthen the Fight Against Non-labor Income," which involves a sharp intensification of anti-corruption measures, crackdowns on falsifications, and the shadow economy, as well as the introduction of material accountability and income declaration requirements. In addition to tightening legislation, the decree also encourages cashless transactions and allows for the legalization of small private enterprises in rural areas.|@Opinions on the necessity of adopting this decree are divided.

According to them, in April-May 1940 out of approximately 15,000 Polish officers held in these three camps, 394 people were transferred to the Gryazovets camp. Most of them were "transferred to the disposal" of the NKVD departments of the Smolensk, Voroshilovgrad, and Kalinin regions and are no longer mentioned in the NKVD's statistical reports.|@The uncovered archival materials collectively allow the conclusion that Beria, Merkulov and their accomplices bear direct responsibility for the atrocities in the Katyn Forest.|@{0}, expressing deep regret over the Katyn tragedy, declares that it represents one of the heinous crimes of Stalinism.|@Copies of the discovered documents have been handed over to the Polish side.

        <events82Desc autoNewLine="true" newLineParagraph="true">@The Polish leadership has repeatedly appealed to us with a request to create a joint commission to examine the "Katyn issue." For many years, Soviet leadership, followed by Soviet historians, blamed the murder of Polish officers in Katyn on the Nazi invaders. However, during the war itself, evidence emerged indicating that the massacre had taken place earlier, in the spring of 1940, and was organized by the NKVD. In 1944, the "Burdenko Commission" was established in the liberated territories, which confirmed the Soviet perspective. Nevertheless, the issue of the murdered officers left a lasting mark on the relations between {0} and Poland over the following decades.|@Recently, several Soviet historians, granted access to previously closed archives, have uncovered previously unknown materials from the Main Directorate of the NKVD USSR, relating to the so-called "Katyn case."|@According to these materials, as of early January 1940, there were about 14,000 former Polish citizens in the camps of the Main Directorate of the NKVD for Prisoners of War and Internees. In April-May 1940, the individuals held in all three camps were transferred to the disposal of various regional NKVD departments.|@As a result of a thorough inspection of the relevant archives, we have not found direct evidence (orders, instructions, etc.) that would allow us to determine the exact time and specific perpetrators of the Katyn tragedy. At the same time, indirect evidence has been discovered in the archival legacy of the Main Directorate of the NKVD for Prisoners of War and Internees that casts doubt on the credibility of the "Burdenko Commission." Based on them, one can conclude that the deaths of the Polish officers in the Katyn area were the work of the NKVD, personally orchestrated by Beria and Merkulov.|@The question arises as to how and when to inform the Polish and our public about this conclusion.</events82Desc>
